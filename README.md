# C_Strings ðŸ§µ

Welcome to the **C_Strings** repository! This project contains a collection of exercises focused on string manipulation in the C programming language. These exercises were completed as part of the Foundations of Computer Science course during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania.

## Exercises Overview

This repository includes a variety of exercises that focus on different aspects of string manipulation. Below is a brief overview of some of the exercises you will find:

### Exercise 1: Basic String Operations

This exercise covers basic operations such as concatenation, comparison, and length calculation. You will implement functions to perform these operations without using standard library functions.

### Exercise 2: String Reversal

In this exercise, you will write a function to reverse a given string. You will explore different approaches to achieve this, including iterative and recursive methods.

### Exercise 3: Palindrome Check

You will implement a function to check if a string is a palindrome. This exercise will help you understand string traversal and character comparison.

### Exercise 4: Substring Search

This exercise focuses on searching for a substring within a string. You will implement a function that returns the starting index of the first occurrence of a substring.

### Exercise 5: String Tokenization

In this exercise, you will write a function to tokenize a string based on a given delimiter. This will help you understand how to manipulate strings and extract meaningful data.

### Exercise 6: Dynamic Memory Allocation

You will explore dynamic memory allocation in this exercise by creating a function that dynamically allocates memory for a string and handles memory deallocation.

Each exercise comes with comments and explanations to help you understand the concepts better.

## Usage

To use the exercises in this repository, simply follow the instructions in the **Getting Started** section. You can modify the code to experiment with different scenarios and improve your understanding of C strings.
